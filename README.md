# fee-feed
Minimal Ethereum fee data viewer for the terminal, contained in a single python script. Connects to your node and displays some
metrics in real-time.

Boxplots of fees for the past few hundred blocks to give context
to the fee market.

### Installation

Optionally create an environment with python 3.x

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies

    pip install requests python-dotenv


### Node configuration

Create a file called '.env' and populated it with the url for your 
node as follows:

    RPC_URL='http://localhost:8545'

### Operation

(optional) activate environment:

    source venv/bin/activate

Run

    python fee-feed.py

On startup, details of transactions in the first block will be displayed.
After the display is started, the receipts of the last 200 blocks
are fetched, which can take a minute for a local node.

Control with the keyboard:

- number to change mode
- q to quit.

## Networks

Functions with any testnet without configuration, tested on:

- Mainnet pre-London
- Goerli post-London.

## Upgrades

You can add new modes pretty easily:

1. Add a mode the configuration section at the
top of the file, replicating what is already there, and changing the
names and button.
2. Add a function to populate your newly named data. Search for
"# Add new data functions here."
